# CFAPythonFundamental
The CFA institute requires candidates to take a practical skills module during their charter journey. My choice was to do it on the Python Fundamentals in Finance. This code is the final capstone project that was required to be made. However I did make some minor adjustments and pulled more recent data. All the code was done in Python on Juypter Notebook. There is an extra HTML file because some of the graphs did not render properly. The raw data is viewable in the Amazon.csv and stock_data.csv
